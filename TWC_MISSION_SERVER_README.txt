This is version 1.18 of the TWC Mission Server.

Primarily designed and written by TWC_Fatal_Error and TWC_Flug, with contributions from many others, ideas and code snippets from a wide variety of online forums and repositories as well as extensive discussion and code from various server programmers and CloD gurus.

The Mission Server is for IL2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover (Team Fusion v. 4.312) and features a comprehensive stats package with in-game and online stats reporting, rank & promotion system, re-load & re-arm capability for all aircraft, ground vehicles attending all aircraft at takeoff and landing, and some of the most realistic and skilled AI pilot opponents Cliffs of Dover has ever seen.

This release includes all files used to run the server and is intended as a resource and inspiration for others who may want to create missions or online servers. 

Mission designers are welcome to find inspiration or ideas here, of course, but you may also use c# and mission code samples as long as credit is given to TWC - The Wrecking Crew, http://twcclan.com/
